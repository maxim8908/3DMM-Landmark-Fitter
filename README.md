# 3DMM-Landmark-Fitter

A PyTorch-based implementation of a **3D Morphable Model (3DMM)** landmark fitting pipeline.  
This tool fits PCA-based 3D face models to target meshes using sparse 3D landmark constraints â€” a core component of facial analysis, scan alignment, and identity modeling workflows.

## Features

- Fit 3DMM shape coefficients from sparse 3D landmarks  
- Supports `.obj` meshes, `.npy` vertex data, and offset reconstruction  
- Optional per-landmark weighting and L2 regularization  
- Loss tracking and landmark error reporting  
- Easily scriptable for batch fitting
